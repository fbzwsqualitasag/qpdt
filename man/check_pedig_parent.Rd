\description{
Some descriptive statistics about the pedigree are collected. The main
check consists of the comparison of the birthdates of animals to the
birthdates of their parents. The check of birthdates can be parametrized
by a minimal tolerance of the difference using the argument \code{pn_bd_tol}.
The last check lists all animals that have the same IDs as one of their
parents.
}
\details{
The comparison of the birthdates is done via a join of the parent birthdates
to a tibble that consists of only animals, their birthdates and their parents.
The comparison is done for sires and dams in two separate steps.
